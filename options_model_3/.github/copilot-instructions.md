## Project: Options Pricing with Neural Networks and Heston Calibration

This workspace contains improved implementations of:
- Neural network IV surface training
- Heston model calibration 
- GPU-accelerated option pricing
- Comprehensive testing suite

Key improvements implemented:
- Fixed IVSurfaceModel.fit method
- Improved DataScaler with proper centering around S0
- Better device handling for PyTorch models
- Vega-weighted loss function for calibration
- Robust error handling in Heston calibration
